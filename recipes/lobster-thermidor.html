                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Divide mixture among the lobster tail shells; 
                        place in prepared foil-lined pan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sprinkle each lobster tail with about 
                        1/2 teaspoon bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon grated cheese

                nicely browned and heated through, about 10 minutes.
                If you like, you can turn on the broiler and broil 
                1 minute until tops are golden and crispy.
